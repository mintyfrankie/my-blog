# About Me

Hi, stranger. A genuine welcome to this Internet shelter.

## The human

Below you may find a mechanical version of me:

```python
class thisHuman():
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = 'Yunan Wang'
        self.location = 'Paris, France'
        self.occupation = 'master student'
        self.organisation = 'Université Paris 1 Panthéon Sorbonne'
        self.field = 'Development Studies'
        self.languages = {
            '普通话': 'native',
            'English': 'professional',
            'Français': 'professional',
            'Italiano': 'beginner',
            'Chinese dialects': ('Cantonese', 'Teochew')
        }
```

However, I prefer a more "organic" interpretation of me, even though it is simplistic to summarise an individuals by a set of tags or adjectives.

The self introduction you might first see on the home page is somewhat a way of generalisation that I prefer:

> a **_Minimalist_**,
>
> a **_Sustainability_** advocate,
>
> and a Amateur **_programmer_**

I think these three tags summarise, to a very limited extent, my personality, my fields of interest and my life objectives. Nevertheless, feel free to read through my articles to have a subtle understanding of this human.

### What am I up to recently

- Learning Italian (just finished a beginner course)
- Messing around my cloud server (this site as the fruit of this effort)
- Training myself to be able to sign up for a half-marathon next year

## The site

This site serves for both presenting myself and sharing my thoughts and experience. I expect that visitors might have a culturally and linguistically diverse background, so I would not limit to writing in a certain language; but the information would probably be most accessible in English. (I wish I could write an article sooner or later.)

There won't be any major themes for the site, but I expect them to be following:

- Reflections on life and other meaningless stuff
- Technical sharing
- Thoughts on certain events

As of October 2023, the site is built from scratch with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and hosted on Cloudflare Pages.
