Sitting right in front of my monitor, I am writing down this very first blog article. Why _Being a minimalist_? Because I found it interesting but also necessary to explain the headlines I have given to me.

Being a minimalist is not simply a declaration, but a way of life. It can be a _jargon_ that everyone keeps talking about it, but nobody can reach to a consensus on what it really means. I have considered myself minimalist back in 2015, so actually it has been almost eight years that I put this tag on me, that I make efforts to implement those _minimalistic_ principles on every walk of my life.

The word _minimalist_ is always associated with a bunch of fuzzy words like _"less is more"_, _"anti-consumerism"_, or even words like _"meditation"_, _"Zen"_ or even _"yoga"_[^1]. I would say that for me, being a minimalist just means one thing -- that you make daily, constant efforts to understand what kind of things, either tangible or not, are those you really need or desire for.

[^1]: I did come across a webpage arguing that you should practice "minimalist yoga". I just cannot understand what it really means. Is sitting there doing nothing considered as part of this fashion?

As a failed model of minimalist, I do possess a lot of things: I've invested a lot in my digital setup that includes a MacBook, an external monitor, an iPad Mini, an iPhone and an Apple Watch[^2]. As for those of less tangible, I am also fond of **productivity and digital tools**: I have a personal cloud server where I host my website and a bunch of self-hosted services I am using every day; I use [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/) for my GTD management and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for storing and linking my daily notes and knowledge management. You can say, apparently I am not the one who loves to live in a tiny lodge near the Walden Pond, nor one of the Amish who practice extreme technological Puritanism.

But meanwhile, I also hate cluttering. No matter if it is a bunch of random stuff spawning in my living room, or if it is some fancy applications on my phone screen. Decluttering is actually sitting in the very core of my life philosophy, that I will apply whenever it is possible. It works on social relations, too: I'd rather cherish a two-hour one-to-one phone call with one of my friends to catch up and to discuss stuff, rather than allowing myself browsing and jumping back and forth on my Messenger group chats and PMs. All these tiny choices and decisions are without doubt making a huge impact, despite trivial on the short span of time, on how we can invest our time and attention into things we take **intentionally**, or those that we take with less attention. After all, in a world where [attention economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy) is sadly the Golden Rule, one has to take into account one thing we can give up mindlessly: our time.

So yeah, being a minimalist doesn't mean that you have a desktop setup that looks clean, that your house doesn't have much decoration, or that your house must not have more than X objects. It is frustrating to see people always regard minimalism either as a concept of aesthetics, or as a marginal way of life that only a few nerds will have fun experimenting with. For me, minimalism is really about a **mindset**, the **intentionality** and not taking all for granted. Call yourself also a minimalist if you check all these boxes.

[^2]: I hate to admit, but yeah, I am an Apple fanboy, at least for the time being.
