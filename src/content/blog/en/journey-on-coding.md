Recently I finished an excellent course called "[Crash Course Computer Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5nskjZ_GoI)". Nothing fancy, just some general introduction to the history of all the foundations that constitute our contemporary landscape today: computers, Internet, robots. 

But I somehow found it extremely enjoying, as I've never been exposed to such way of storytelling. Let alone my stories of so-called "self-taught" programmers, not for a day I was trained as a programmer nor a software engineer. I don't know if I were to be a CS student, I could have had the same joy in some university courses; yet I genuinely enjoyed the way the lecturer (Thanks Carrie Anne!) decomposed all the fancy technologies today down to tiny bits of logical gates, of bytes and of transistors. Despite all the efforts of our predecessors to build up a complex mesh of virtuality, it seems to me now that all these tools can be **traced down**, it was not a fancy blackbox anymore. 

My journey of coding was nothing fancy, neither. My very first interest in coding stemmed from the exact software 10 years ago, that I happen to be using today, called [**OmniFocus**](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/). Amazed by the vision of GTD it provides to manage the whole of your life, I soaked into the world of productivity, and more precisely, how computers can contribute to get more things done, in a quicker and more organised manner, and for a better quality.

This interest gradually expanded to **the use of devices** itself: how can I take notes quicker? No more Microsoft Word, let's use Markdown instead. When I fire up my phone, how can I launch the application I want quicker? The timed killer app back into 2014 at the time was the famous [Launch Center Pro](https://learnomnifocus.com/app/launch-center-pro/). I still very much miss the golden age at that time when we had a whole bunch of communities (in Chinese and in English) gathering up geeks; they will share their home screens, their workflows and their tricks to do magic. Today's Internet, however, seems to less appreciate this niche, and people would rather spend more time on Tiktok or Netflix. 

I remember the first "programming language" that I started to learn is **Apple Script**. One might say, it is **not** a programming language, and I as of today will totally agree. Yet, back then I found myself fascinated by the possibility to "write" a script that can do so much more than dragging mouse to click buttons. In other words, it was a paradigm shift for me: there is a more structured, recordable and replicable ways to do stuff. And here started my formal journey to code.

10 years after, I still haven't been a CS student for a single day, and all the programming languages I know, let alone master, get counted by less than one hand. But I would still be proud of calling myself a "programming amateur", because for me I have no longer fair of errors highlighted in red, black-and-white command lines or lines of obscure codes. I will get myself to learn a new programming language when I need to, search for information on Stack Overflow when getting an error message, and will not hesitate to spend hours in front of my screens to realise my ideas by coding. Coding, or more broadly speaking spending time on computers, has become one of my very hobbies. Just like others who love to spend time on their motorbikes or fishing equipments, computers have become my object of "bricolage", and I seem to enjoy it very much.
