# About

I am a young professional navigating at the intersection of data and sustainability. I like to drive changes in the practices of decarbonation, circular economy and social justice. 

I am passionate about the earth we live in, about codes and technologies, and about people, everyone with their own joy, conflicts, and dreams. In my professional goals, I'd love to find a way to reconcile, integrate and leverage all these three passions, yet I am discovering how. My past experiences have helped me create insights about each of these domains, and now it's time to make them work together.

In my spare time, coding, cooking and hiking are my most-invested hobbies. I find these three domains **a natural extension** of myself, in terms of hands, mouth and feet. 

I believe that sustainability seems to be a big word, but after all we human beings are just being selfish when we talk about it. We want to live in a world that is not too hot, not too cold, not too polluted, not too crowded, not too unfair. We want to live in a world that is just right for us. And that's what sustainability is about. It's about making sure that the world is just right for us, for the less advantaged, and for the generations to come.
